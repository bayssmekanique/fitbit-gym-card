# Gym Card Fitbit App

**Target Devices:** Ionic

This is a simple app which turns the watch face into a [Code39](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_39) barcode.  Its intended use is to simplify entry into gyms by allowing users to enter their gym card ID into the app, which stores the ID into the watch and displays the ID as a bardcode (rather than having to cary their gym card with them).
